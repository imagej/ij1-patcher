/**
 * Limited headless support for ImageJ 1.x.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Headless operation</i> means: does not require a graphical user interface
 * (GUI). Due to some limitations in Java on Linux and Unix, it is impossible to
 * instantiate GUI elements when there is no way to display them (i.e. when
 * there is no desktop environment) -- even if they are never to be displayed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Therefore, even when running in batch mode, we have to prevent GUI elements
 * -- such as dialogs -- to be instantiated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, ImageJ 1.x' macro handling works exclusively by instantiating
 * dialogs (but not displaying them). Macros are executed by overriding the
 * dialog methods to extract the user-specified values.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The limited legacy headless support overrides {@link ij.gui.GenericDialog} to
 * <b>not</b> be a subclass of {@link java.awt.Dialog}. This will always be a
 * fragile solution, especially with plugins trying to add additional GUI
 * elements to the dialog: when those GUI elements are instantiated, Java will
 * throw a {@link java.awt.HeadlessException}. Hence the legacy headless support
 * only works with standard (i.e. non-fancy) plugins; this could only be fixed
 * by overriding the plugin class loader with a version inspecting every plugin
 * class and using Javassist to override such instantiations. Given that
 * ImageJ2's architecture handles headless operation much more gracefully, that
 * enormous effort would have little to gain.
 * </p>
